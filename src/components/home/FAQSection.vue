      <div class="FAQ-content">
        <p>Purchases are tracked via your Impact account and the unique product links available there. If your incoming
          link converts to a sale you are paid for the product sale.</p>
        <p>There is a 30 day cookie which means your customer is allowed a long window of time to make their purchasing
          decision. Note that many programs are only 7 days.</p>
